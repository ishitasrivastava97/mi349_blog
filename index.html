                        <li>Salt to taste</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Let's get started: </h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>First, presoak the Rajma beans overnight.</li>
                        <li>In a pressure cooker add beans, water and salt and pressure cook for 2 whistles and then on low heat for 10 minutes. Let the pressure realse on it's own and then open the cooker.</li>
                        <li>Strain the liquid of the beans and keep it aside for the gravy.</li>
                        <li>Heat a pan, add oil. Now add Cumin seeds, black pepper, Cinnamon, Black Cardamom and Bay leaves.</li>
                        <li>Add onions and fry till golden brown.</li>
                        <li>Now add the garlic paste and ginger paste. Add a table spoon of water. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Add Turmeric powder and coriander powder. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes.                        </li>
                        <li>Now add salt. Close the lid for a 1 to 2 minutes to cook the Masala.</li>
                        <li>add the Tomato paste and stir. Tomato paste is just ground chopped tomato into a paste.                        </li>
                        <li>Add the green chili paste and stir again.</li>
                        <li>Cover and cook for 3-4 minutes or until the Masala leaves the oil.                        </li>
                        <li>Add the boiled and strained Rajma in the Masala and stir.                        </li>
                        <li>Add Garam Masala to this and mix well. </li>
                        <li>Add the Rajma water that was kept aside while straining Boiled Rajma.                        </li>
                        <li>Mix everything, cover, and bring to a boil. Now lower the heat and cook for 5 to 7 minutes so that the Masala imparts a flavor to the Rajma beans.</li>
                        <li>The Rajma looks done now. Discard the Bay leaves.
                            Garnish it with chopped coriander leaves.
                            </li>
                    </ol>
                <p>Rajma Masala is ready to be served. You can serve it with Roti or Naan and rice. A very popular serving suggestion is to serve it with just plain rice.
                    Enjoy the filling comfort food.
